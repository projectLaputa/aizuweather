AizuWeather is system that get weather data (Temperature, Pressure, Humidity) from many instruments there are in Fukushima, Aizu-Wakamatsu. And can see these on web.

Now, I'm developing this web system. Instruments have been developed, too. So, this system update frequently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AizuWeather is consists of three parts - sessions, users, instruments.

-Sessions
  Sign In(/sessions/new) = index.html

-Users
  Listing Users(/users) [only admin]
  New User(/users/new)
* MyPage(users/:id)

-Instruments
  Listing Instruments(/instruments) [can't destroy and edit]
* New Instrument(/instruments/new)
  Show(instruments/:id)
* Edit(instruments/:id/edit)

*: These pages can access only when you login.
If you try to access these pages without login, redirect to SignIn page(/sessions/new).

MyPage is listing each user's all instruments and can destroy or edit these. If you are admin user, it's listing all instruments.

Listing Instruments(/instruments): We can all instruments position on the one map.
